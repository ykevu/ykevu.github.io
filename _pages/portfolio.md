### DeepCell Label

![DeepCell Label](/images/DeepCellLabel.png)

How can we obtain large amounts of rich biological image data for deep learning pipelines? Tailor-made software for data annotation is crucial for complex human-in-the-loop frameworks. DeepCell Label is a cloud-based web application using Flask and React that allows anyone to remotely annotate biological image data with segmentation masks, division events, spots, and cell types. As a Software Engineer in the Van Valen Lab, I have been the primary developer and maintainer of DeepCell Label for the past year and added functionality for interactive cell type annotation, on-the-fly marker expression analyses, and in-browser training using Tensorflow.js for active learning accelerated labeling.
