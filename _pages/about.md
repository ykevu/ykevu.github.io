## About me

I am currently a Software Engineer in the [Van Valen Group](https://www.vanvalen.caltech.edu/) as part of Caltech's [SASE program](https://sase.caltech.edu/). For my undergraduate studies, I attended Caltech and received a B.S. in Chemistry and Computer Science in 2022.

My primary research interest lies in predictive chemistry and the development or exploration of computational tools, models, and frameworks that can enhance the productivity of synthetic chemists. To that end, I will joining the [Coley Group](https://coley.mit.edu/) in Fall 2023 while pursuing an SM in Computational Science and Engineering.
