## About me

I am a graduate researcher in the [Coley Group](https://coley.mit.edu/) at MIT. My primary research interest lies in predictive chemistry and the development of computational tools, models, and algorithms that can accelerate discovery in the chemical sciences. 

In the past, I was a Software Engineer in the [Van Valen Group](https://www.vanvalen.caltech.edu/) as part of Caltech's [SASE program](https://sase.caltech.edu/). (Generally speaking, I am a strong proponent of open-source software). For my undergraduate studies, I attended Caltech, where I did research in the Fu Group and received a B.S. in Chemistry and Computer Science in 2022. 

Outside of academics, I enjoy playing board games, doing crosswords, watching movies, taking photos, shooting and editing videos, playing racket sports, visiting art museums, and listening to or attending musical theater and concerts. In the past, I was heavily involved in academic competitions, especially [Quizbowl](https://www.naqt.com/about/quiz-bowl.html).
