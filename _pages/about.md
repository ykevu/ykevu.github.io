## About me

I am currently a Software Engineer in the [Van Valen Group](https://www.vanvalen.caltech.edu/) as part of Caltech's [SASE program](https://sase.caltech.edu/). For my undergraduate studies, I attended Caltech and received a B.S. in Chemistry and Computer Science in 2022.

My primary research interest lies in predictive chemistry and the development or exploration of computational tools, models, and frameworks that can enhance the productivity of synthetic chemists. To that end, I will be joining the [Coley Group](https://coley.mit.edu/) in Fall 2023 while pursuing an SM in Computational Science and Engineering at MIT. I am also interested in developing easy-to-use, aesthetically pleasing, and practical web applications for science, a sentiment which drives my [current work](https://label-dev.deepcell.org/) in the Van Valen Group. Generally speaking, I am a strong proponent of open-source software.

Outside of academics, I enjoy playing board games, doing crosswords, watching movies, taking photos, shooting and editing videos, playing racket sports, visiting art museums, and listening to or attending musical theater. In the past, I was extremely involved in academic competitions, especially [Quizbowl](https://www.naqt.com/about/quiz-bowl.html).
